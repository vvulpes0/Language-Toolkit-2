.SH NAME
pleb \- Piecewise / Local Expression Builder
.SH DESCRIPTION
A Pleb file defines a language (set of strings) by a logical expression,
and may also define named sets of symbols or named expressions.
The language is powerful enough
to define any language that a finite-state automaton can describe,
but its design centers around the subset of these languages in which
the set of factors that occur in a word is sufficient information
to determine whether that word is in the language.
.SS Basic Syntax
Whitespace,
.RI < ws >,
is ignored everywhere
except within tokens
or where it is explicitly mentioned in the grammar.
Comments are considered whitespace.
.PP
.RS
.RI < comment >
::=
.B #
.RI [< non-newline "> ...\&]"
.RI < newline >
.RE
.PP
A file (program) is a non-empty sequence of statements.
When using
.B LTK.Porters.Pleb.readPleb
to evaluate a program,
the result is the value of the special variable
.BR it .
This is generally the final bare expression (if any).
In the case that
.B it
has no value, this method of evaluation returns an error.
The resulting automaton (if any) is constructed with respect
to the alphabet described by the special variable
.BR universe ,
which collects all symbols used throughout the file.
.PP
.RS
.RI < program >
::=
.RI < statement >
.RI [< statement "> ...\&]"
.RE
.PP
A statement is either
an expression or
an assignment of either a symbol set or an expression.
.PP
.RS
.RI < statement >
::=
.RI < sym-assign "> | <" exp-assign "> | <" exp >
.PP
.RI < sym-assign >

.B =
.RI < name >
.B {
.RI < symbols >
.RB [ ,
.RI < symbols "> ...\&]"
.B }
.RS
.RE
.BR "             " "  |"
.B =
.RI < name >
.B (

An expression comes in one of three types.
It can be an n-ary expression, a unary expression, or a factor.
Additionally it can be the name of a defined subexpression.
.PP
.RS
.RI < exp >
::=
.RI < name "> | <" n-ary "> | <" unary "> | <" factor >
.PP
.RI < n-ary >
::=
.RI < n-op >
.B {
.RI < exp >
.RB [ ,
.RI < exp "> ...\&]"
.B }
.RS
.RE
.BR "        " "  |"
.RI < n-op >
.B (
.RI < exp >
.RB [ ,
.RI < exp "> ...\&]"
.B )
.PP
.RI < unary >
::=
.RI < u-op >
.RI < exp >
.RE
.PP
Factors are a bit more complicated.
The basic form of a factor
is a sequence of symbol sets
separated by
.RI < r-op >,
which can be either
.RI < ws >
for adjacency or
.B ,
for (long-distance) precedence.
Additionally, a factor can be either free (without anchors)
or anchored to one or both of the head or tail of a string.
Finally, a factor can be the name of a factor-type variable.
.PP
.RS
.RI < factor >
::=
.RI < name >
.RS
.RE
.BR "        " "   |"
.RI [< anchors >]

.RI [< symbols >
.RI [< r-op "> <" symbols "> ...\&]]"

.PP
The first compound kind of factor combines its sub-factors
with the adjacency relation,
and the other with the (long-distance) precedence relation.
The anchors are denoted as follows.
.PP
.RS
.RI < anchors >
::=
.RI < head-tail "> | <" head "> | <" tail >
.PP
.RI < head-tail >
::=
.B "%||%"
.PP
.RI < head >
::=
.B "%|"
.PP
.RI < tail >
::=
.B "|%"
.RE
.PP
Note that
.RI < head-tail >
is treated as a single token;
no whitespace may occur within the
.B "%||%"
sequence
(in particular, not between
.B "%|"
and
.BR "|%" ).
.PP
As described previously the relation operators,
.RI < r-op >,
in a
.RI < factor >
can be either whitespace to represent the adjacency relation,
or a comma to represent the (long-distance) precedence relation.
.PP
.RS
.RI < r-op >
::=
.RI < ws "> |"
.B ,
.RE
.PP
Symbol sets are either singleton (represent by a
.B /
prefix)
or the name of some already-defined symbol set.
.PP
.RS
.RI < symbols >
::=
.B /
.RI < name "> | <" name >
.RE
.PP
A name is a letter as defined by Unicode
followed by any sequence of characters
other than whitespace or characters from the following set:
.RS
.B , [ ] ( ) { } < >
.RE
Note that this includes the
.B #
character, so a comment cannot occur in the middle of a name.
.SS N-ary Operators
An n-ary operator can be any of the following.
The first option, as with the anchors described previously,
is pure ASCII, while the other options may be Unicode.
.TP
.B /\e
The set intersection (logical conjunction) of the operands.
.TP
.B \e/
The set union (logical disjunction) of the operands.
.TP
.B @@
The gapped-concatenation of the operands,
equivalent to normal concatenation except that
arbitrary strings may be inserted between the operands.
.TP
.B @
The concatenation of the operands.
Note that non-anchored ends of factor-expressions
automatically allow arbitrary strings to occur,
so this concatenation may not be what one expects.
It is better to use the
.BR .\&< ...\& >
form in that case.
.SS Unary Operators
This section describes the unary relations just as
the previous section described the n-ary ones.
.TP
.BR ~ " | " !
The logical negation of the operand.
Equivalent to the set complement of the operand.
.TP
.B *
The iteration closure of the operand.
Allow it to occur zero or more times.
This has the same caveat as the concatenation operator:
factor-expressions that are not fully anchored
may have arbitrary strings at the non-anchored ends.
.PP
.B [
.RI < symbols "> ["
.B ,
.RI < symbols "> ...\&]"
.B ]
.RS
The symbols defined by the
.RI < symbols >
components specify a tier
on which the operand should occur.
This returns the preprojection of the operand:
the largest language that when projected to the tier
is equal to the operand.
.RE
.SS Unicode Syntax
In addition to the ASCII syntax described previously,
there is a unicode syntax that provides the following synonyms:
.TP
.B =
<U+225D> [equal to by definition]
.TP
.BR < ...\& >
<U+27E8>...\&<U+27E9> [mathematical left/right angle bracket]
.TP
.B %|
<U+22CA> [right normal factor semidirect product]
.TP
.B |%
<U+22C9> [left normal factor semidirect product]
.TP
.B /\e
<U+22C0> [n-ary logical and] or <U+2227> [logical and] or
<U+22C2> [n-ary intersection] or <U+2229> [intersection]
.TP
.B \e/
<U+22C1> [n-ary logical or] or <U+2228> [logical or] or
<U+22C3> [n-ary union] or <U+222A> [union]
.TP
.B @
<U+2219> [bullet operator]
.TP
.B !
<U+00AC> [not sign]
.TP
.B *
<U+2217> [asterisk operator]
.PP
No special setup is needed to use these synonyms,
except possibly configuring your environment
in such a way that they can be easily input.
.SH NOTES
There is currently no way to directly specify finite-state automata,
even though the underlying expression tree accepts them
as a type of expression.
The
.B plebby
interpreter
does create such expressions
when reading automata or compiling expressions.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
.B </a>
The symbol "a" occurs.
.TP
.B [/a]!%||%<>
The same constraint,
written in a TSL manner:
on the tier consisting of
.BR a ,
it is not the case that the word is empty.
.PP
.B = primary {/H'}
.RS
.RE
.B = non-primary {/L, /H}
.RS
.RE
.B = obligatoriness </primary>
.RS
.RE
.B = culminativity !</primary, /primary>
.RS
.RE
.B /\e{obligatoriness, culminativity}
.RS
.IP (1)
Assign the set {H'} to the name
.B primary
.IP (2)
Assign the set {L, H} to the name
.BR non-primary ,
in order to include all of L, H, and H' in
.BR universe.
.IP (3)
Define
.B obligatoriness
to be the constraint
that some element of
.B primary
occurs.
.IP (4)
Define
.B culminativity
to be the constraint
that no more than one element of
.B primary
occurs using the (long-distance) precedence relation.
.IP (5)
Define the special variable
.BR it ,
and thus the result of the program,
as the intersection of
.B obligatoriness
and
.BR culminativity :
the set of strings containing exactly one element of
.BR primary .
