Installing the Local Language Toolkit

These instructions are appropriate for Debian gnu/linux 9.6.0, they should be
valid for any unix environment modulo the appropriate package tools.

1) Install ghc, Haskell parallel libraries, graphviz and imagemagick.
 sudo apt-get install ghc libghc-parallel-dev graphviz imagemagick
(If you are logged in as root, shame on you; presumably, you know what you are
doing.) 

2) cd to the directory in which you will run the toolkit

3) Fetch the current version of the toolkit from
   https://lutras-hacking.ddns.net/ltk/scil19/
   [Dakotah: is there a way to do this with wget?]

4) Unpack the tarball
   tar xzf Language-Toolkit-2-<versionNumber>.tar.gz
Where <versionNumber> will be something like 0.01a.r107
This will create a directory named <versionNumber>

5) Fetch the documentation
   [Where will these be, he wondered]
You will almost certainly want the documentation.

6) Optionally fetch the example pleb and plebby files
   [Where will these be, he wondered]

7) Unpack the documentation.
   tar xf <whatever>

7) cd <versionNumber>
   
8) Compile plebby
   ghc -O2 -threaded -with-rtsopts='-N -C0.001 -qg1' plebby

9) Optionally fetch the StressTyp2 archive
   wget http://st2.ullet.net/files/files/st2-v1-archive-0415.tar.gz

10) unpack the archive
    tar xf st2-v1-archive-0415.tar.gz
This will create the directory st2-v1-archive-0415 in your current directory.

11) Run plebby and test it
   ./plebby
   > :import <plebFiles>/yidin.plebby
   > :display yidin
where <plebFiles> is the path to the directory with the example files.
This should display the automaton for Yidin, as described in the StressTyp2
database.
   > :readJeff st2-v1-archive-0415/transducers/fsasJeff/219_Yidin_SPD.fsa
   > :equal it yidin
If all has gone well this should return True.
You may :quit when you are done.

12) If you would like to use factorize, first compile it
   ghc -O2 -threaded -with-rtsopts='-N -C0.001 -qg1' factorize

13) Next fetch the precompiled non-strict constraints
    wget https://lutras-hacking.ddns.net/ltk/scil19/compiled.tar.gz

14) Unpack them
    tar xf compiled.tar.gz
This will create a directory Compiled along with the compiled constraints and
the file Compiled/constraints, which are required for factorize.

15) Run factorize
    ./factorize st2-v1-archive-0415/transducers/fsasJeff/*
(You may wish to choose a subset of the lects to start with, but the whole
library should take less than 5 minutes.)
The results will be in the directory Results.
